# Base condition:  as long as len of arr > 1
# Break it into left and right and recurse until len or array > 1
# Soring happens in place, so you donâ€™t need a new array.
# One while loop for i< len(left) and j < len(right), find which is greeted and merge
# Two while loops to add the remaining left and right into the array.

# Time Complexity: consistent O(n log n) time complexity. 
# Space Complexity: O(n), since it only requires temp arrays during merge.

# Bottom-up merge sort
# Let's illustrate the bottom-up merge sort with an example array [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]:
# Initial array as subarrays:
# [38],[27],[43],[3],[9],[82],[10]
# Merge Iteratively:
# Merge adjacent pairs: [27,38], [3,43], [9,82],[10]
# Merge adjacent pairs: [3,27,38,43],[9,10,82]
# Merge the last two remaining subarrays: [3,9,10,27,38,43,82]
# Sorted array: 3,9,10,27,38,43,82
